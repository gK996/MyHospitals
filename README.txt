The aim of this project was to replicate the database for the MyHospitals website (myhospitals.gov.au)
for two hospitals using MySQL. Check UML diagram for a visualisation of the design.
Some values and queries are also provided for replicating the data for the given hospitals.
Note: the data is only for two services provided by the hospitals.
